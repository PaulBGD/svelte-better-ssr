# This is an example of how Svelte's SSR can be improved to render a component using a regular Svelte bundle.

## To use

- Go into the `example-app` folder and ran `yarn` (or `npm install`, if you're into that.)
- Then run `yarn run build`.
- Go back into the main directory and run `node index.js`. This will output the three example components (Component2 is rendered twice, once without data and once with.)
